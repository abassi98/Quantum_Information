This folder contains:

1) The program 'Ex2_Bassi_Code_mat2.f', which is the request of the second week exercise. In the outputs it is called simply "mat2.f", because  they were caluclated before renaming
2) The executable file of the porgram 'Ex2_Bassi_Code_mat2.out'
3) The file of the module 'matrices.mod'
4) The pdf of the exercise Ex2.pdf
5) The files 'mat_2x3.txt' and 'adjoint_mat_2x3.txt' contain the correspondent MATRICES written as output by our program. The same for the files 'mat_2x2.txt' and 'adjoint_mat_2x2.txt'
6) For the last two matrices, the avaiable sapace on the report was not enough to report the output of the terminal, so that that had been copied in the file 'square.txt'.
7)Finally 'Ex2_Bassi_Report.pdf' is the file containing the final report of the exercise.
