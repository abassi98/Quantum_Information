- The file "o.txt" and "o1.txt" contain the computattion times vs the diemension fo the matrix for simulations of 3600 and 2400 seconds respectively.
- "g.gnu" code used for making the graphs.
- The two graphs "time.pdf" and "log-time.pdf" with the computation time vs the matrix size for the one hour simulation.
- The report "Ex3_Bassi_Report.pdf"
